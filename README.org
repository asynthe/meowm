/What is meowm?/

meowm is a dynamic window manager written in Rust based on Smithay. This is a personal project, so don't expect many updates.

There are things i want to implement in the future, but this depends on how much time i can put into this project

Things that i want to add:
+ Both a *simple* configuration (i3-like) and a complex one (xmonad-like)
+ *Animations* like Hyprland
+ A terminal that could be dragged from the top of the screen
  - Or side, side-terminal
  - Or any part, with the mouse
+ A zoom-in like wayfire

Extra functionalities once it's working:
+ A swayidle replacement
+ A bar like waybar
+ A rofi/dmenu clone

Things that would be cool but i don't think to add:
+ A cool 3d model of the workspaces wayfire-like
